To show some sort of preparation i have actually typed all of the content for the web page in this here read me. 
I go in and format these paragraphs appropriately into the content boxes i want them to be in. 
starting with the home page 
    - Nav bar followed by some padding 
    - large enhanced JWST image with rounded boarders that span only      few pixel away from left and right edge of page . 
        (Depending on if we can get it to work or not i would like to have JSWT solar images as the background for all of the following pages: my_Favorite, least_Favorite, Things I learned. )
    - seperate the rest of the page  into two div's 
      - Div on right = 20% of the width of the page 
      - Div on the left = 70%
      - 5% padding on either side
    - footer 
      - my name 
      - my email
      - Final Project!
have a card on the right side and larger cards on the side left side. that scrolls with the user. It will have a link to all of the pages.  


Second page is the my favorites page. 
    - nav bar follwed by some padding 
    - large picture of jwst image as the background
